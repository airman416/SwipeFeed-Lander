# Privacy Policy for DayTime

**Effective Date:** July 14, 2025

SwipeFeed LLC ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application DayTime (the "App").

## Information We Collect

### Personal Information We Collect

Currently, we do not collect any personally identifiable information. All activity logs, timers, notes, reflections, and habits you create are stored locally on your device only.

In the future, we may introduce features such as sign-in, cloud backups, and long-term goal tracking. When those features are launched, we will update this policy and request your explicit consent.

### Technical Information We Collect

#### Device and Technical Data
We may collect limited technical data for app functionality and improvement, such as:
- App performance data (crash reports and error logs for debugging)

- Usage analytics (to improve app performance and user experience)

#### Optional Analytics
We may use privacy-friendly analytics (like Apple’s App Analytics or anonymized event tracking) to understand general app usage — such as how often users start a session or adjust the timer — to help improve the experience.

These analytics do not include your content, logs, or personal identity.

#### Location Information
We do not collect precise or coarse location data.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the limited information we collect for the following purposes:

### Core App Functionality
- Providing local storage for your activity logs, timers, and notes

- Enabling features like session tracking and habit reflections on your device

### App Improvement and Analytics
- **Performance monitoring** (identifying and fixing crashes and technical issues)

- **Usage analytics** (understanding how users interact with the app to improve features)

- **Feature development** (analyzing anonymized usage patterns to develop new features)

### Communication
Currently, we do not send any communications as we do not collect contact information.

### Data Processing Legal Basis (GDPR)
Where applicable under GDPR, we process any limited data based on:
- **Consent** (for optional analytics)

- **Legitimate interests** (for app security, fraud prevention, and service improvement)

## Data Storage and Security

### Data Storage
- **Local storage**: All your data is stored securely on your device

- **No cloud storage**: We do not store any data on our servers

- **Backup**: Data backup is managed through your device's standard backup features (e.g., iCloud Backup if enabled)

### Security Measures
While data is stored locally, we implement security best practices in the app:
- **Encryption at rest** (data is stored using your device's encryption)

- **App security** (regular updates to address potential vulnerabilities)

- **Access controls** (data accessible only through the app on your device)

### Data Retention
- **Local data**: Retained on your device until you delete it

- **Analytics data**: Any anonymized analytics data is retained for a limited time for service improvement

- **Error logs**: Technical logs are retained temporarily for debugging purposes

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

### Third-Party Service Providers
Currently, DayTime does not use third-party services that collect user data.

If we integrate such services (e.g., for authentication or analytics) in the future, we will clearly inform you and update this policy. Any providers would be bound by strict data protection agreements.

### Legal Requirements
We may disclose information if required by law, such as:
- In response to legal process (subpoenas, court orders)

- To protect our rights, property, or safety

- To protect the rights, property, or safety of our users

- To prevent fraud or security threats

### Business Transfers
If SwipeFeed LLC is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information (if any is collected in the future) may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will provide notice before any personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Your Rights and Choices

### Account Management
Currently, there are no accounts or server-stored data. All management is local.

### Data Portability
You can export your data using your device's sharing features.

### Notification Controls
Currently, there are no notifications as we do not collect contact information.

### Privacy Controls
We do not use tracking technologies in our mobile app. All data is local and controllable through your device settings.

### Rights Under Privacy Laws

#### For EU Users (GDPR)
Since we collect no personal data, most rights are not applicable. However, you have the right to:
- Object to any future processing

- Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority

#### For California Users (CCPA)
Since we collect no personal information, CCPA rights are limited. We do not sell personal information.

## Children's Privacy

DayTime is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately so we can delete such information.

## International Data Transfers

Since no data is transferred to our servers, there are no international data transfers. Any future transfers would include appropriate safeguards.

## Apple App Store Compliance

In compliance with Apple's App Store guidelines, we:
- Provide this privacy policy link in our App Store metadata

- Clearly disclose all data collection practices (which are minimal)

- Do not require personal information for any features

- Respect user permission settings for data access

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, regulatory, or operational reasons. We will notify you of any material changes by:
- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the app

- Updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy

- Sending you a notification through the app (for significant changes, if contact features are added)

Your continued use of the App after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
