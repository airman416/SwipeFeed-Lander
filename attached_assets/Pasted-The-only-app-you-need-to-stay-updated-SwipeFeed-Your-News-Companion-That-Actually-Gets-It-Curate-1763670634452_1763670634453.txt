SwipeFeed: Your News Companion That Actually Gets It

Curated news highlights that respect your time. We're not replacing journalism—we're making it digestible.

Remember when you could stay informed without losing three hours down a rabbit hole? SwipeFeed is your news sidekick with a vertical swipe interface for real journalism. Think of us as the friend who reads everything and gives you the highlights that actually matter.

Why We're Not Like Other News Apps

Your Daily Digest - Think of it as your morning briefing that doesn't require a journalism degree to understand. We curate and condense the day's essential stories, then link you to the full articles when you want to dive deeper. It's like having a really smart friend filter the noise.

Time-Saving Format - Finally, a news companion that understands you learned to consume media vertically. Each story gets a clean, focused summary that tells you what you need to know in seconds, not paragraphs. When you want the full picture, tap through to the original source.

Built-in Boundaries - Limited daily content because we're not trying to steal your entire day. Get informed, save what's important, then go touch some grass. Revolutionary concept, we know.

One-Tap Saves - Spot something worth revisiting during your commute? Save it for when you're not juggling coffee and existential dread. Perfect for those moments when you actually have five minutes to dive deeper into something that caught your attention.

Source Transparency That Hits - Every story shows exactly where it came from. We only work with legit outlets because you've been burned by fake news enough times. Trust, but verify—we make it easy.

The Vibe Check

We're not trying to replace your favorite news sources—we're here to make them more accessible. Think of SwipeFeed as the efficient friend who pre-reads everything and gives you the highlights in a format your brain actually enjoys processing.

This is for people who want to stay informed but also have lives to live. Get your news briefing, save what's worth exploring later, and move on with your day knowing you didn't miss anything important.

Download SwipeFeed - your time-saving news companion that bridges the gap between staying informed and actually having time for everything else.
